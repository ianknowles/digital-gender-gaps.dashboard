index.jumbo.desc=Tracking progress on gender inequalities in internet and mobile access and use is more important than ever to ensure that women benefit from the digital revolution. Data on gender gaps in internet and mobile phone use and access are significantly lacking geographical coverage, comparability, and are slow to be updated. We show how big data can help close this gender data gap and measure progress towards this important development goal in real-time.
